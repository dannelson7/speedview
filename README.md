SpeedView
=========

Firefox add-on that lets you quickly view all external JavaScript and CSS files on the current page.

Modern websites store the majority of their JavaScript and CSS in external files. When developing websites, it can be very helpful to be able to see these external JS and CSS files without having to go through multiple steps. SpeedView lets you view all the attached JavaScript and CSS with the click of a button (or a keyboard shortcut). Once you are viewing the files, you also have the option of clicking on a file name to open it in a new tab. This lets you view the source of the file. If the JavaScript or CSS is cached by your browser, you can also hit the reload button at this time to get the latest version of the file and break it out of the cache.

Inspired by the now defunct 'JSView' add-on, SpeedView gives you quick viewing access to JavaScript and CSS files on any website.
